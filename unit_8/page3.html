  <p>"Focus on what never changes" - still one of the most significant phrases you'll hear in your career as a marketer.<br><br>Not least in this marvelous digital age with its relentless siren songs of instant fixes.<br><br>It's so intoxicating, all this newness, so liberating with its catchy calls to "work smarter".<br><br>But, just like oxygen and sunshine and love and other immutables, being the very best takes hard work.<br><br>At your company, good or even ok creativity may be preferable to all that goes with shooting for greatness: the time, the trouble, the exhaustion, the increased alcohol intake, the lack of socializing, the highs, the lows, the divorces - but, above all in many companies, simply <em>the sheer inconvenience</em>.<br><br>Yes the digital age is a wondrous leveler, making available what Marx called the means of production to a bigger portion of humanity than ever before.<br><br>Which makes me so disappointed when I hear this beautiful idea &#45; digital &#45; used as a byword for fast or easy or instant as in slapdash and mediocre.<br><br>Yes, businesses get built wonderfully fast these digitally&#45;powered days and in completely different ways, often with no need of capital expenditure other than the cost of a laptop.<br><br>But when a business has been built, its personality still needs maintenance. Not least because that personality - The Brand - is what abides in the minds of customers.<br><br>The Brand takes a different kind of care, attention and maintenance, which, though ancillary to the central business, will only be as brilliant as the people who attend to it.<br><br>Much as many people regard marketing and advertising as secondary elements, if you want 100&#8453; of your business to be world-class then you need 100% world-class people and practices.<br><br>Key to creating great advertising or great anything is an age-old four-word phrase:<br><br>No pain, no gain.<br><br>Want to run a sub-four minute mile? Know it&#39;ll hurt.<br><br>Want to look ripped&#63; Know there will be sacrifices.<br><br>Want to write the great American novel&#63; Prepare to sit alone. A lot. For a long time. In silence.<br><br>Creatively-gifted and want to parlay it into greatness&#63; The only thing in existence to enhance your talent is hard work.<br><br>Even the head of a world-changing social network knows that creative brilliance is but the fabled 1&#8453; &#45; inspiration. You still need the 99&#8453; perspiration to turn it ito something.<br><br>Think of a moment that we&#39;ve all experienced:<br><br>It&#39;s taken you a long week of hard work, but as 5pm Friday approaches... you crack it! There on the screen or page in front of you is something people are really going to like.<br><br>All around you colleagues begin that familiar stirring that signals Friday night fun is the only remaining order of the week.<br><br>You like what you&#39;ve done, so you happily join the joyful exodus...<br><br>Next time this happens, just before you stop working, try really hard to just stay in the moment - it's a defining one:<br><br>Imagine 75&#45;year old you looking back on whatever life you&#39;ve had and ask if she or he is happy that you stopped working whenever you liked what you&#39;d done.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to budge from my work if I'd done something I liked.<br><br>Not until it was something I loved.<br><br>It hurt to work for that extra quality, it really did.<br><br>Yes, you miss out on a bunch of stuff when you&#39;re working to your full potential: everything from normal family life to wild and crazy partying; oh, and sleep, good health, sometimes even sanity.<br><br>But, after managing to string together a couple years of those defining moments, in the late 1990s I became the highest earning copywriter in the UK, probably in the world.<br><br>I didn't notice at the time.<br><br>Too wrapped up in the joy of discovering my full potential.</p>
