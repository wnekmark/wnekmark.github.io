  <p>&#147;Focus on what never changes&#148; &#45; a phrase you&#39;ll hear over and over on this site.<br><br>Having to work hard and dig deep to be the best never changes.<br><br>At your company, good or even ok creativity may be preferable to all that goes with shooting for greatness: the time, the trouble, the exhaustion, the anger, the alcohol&#47;drug intake, the lack of socializing, the mood swings, the divorces.<br><br>Yes the digital age is a wondrous leveler, making available what Marx called the means of production to a bigger portion of humanity than ever before.<br><br>Which makes me so disappointed when I hear this beautiful idea &#45; digital &#45; used as a byword for fast as in slapdash and mediocre.<br><br>Yes businesses get built fast these digitally&#45;powered days and in completely different ways, often with no need of capital expenditure other than the cost of a laptop.<br><br>But when a business has been built, its fa&#231;ade still needs maintenance. Not least that part of its fa&#231;ade that exists in the minds of customers&#58; the marketing and the advertising.<br><br>Marketing and advertising take a different kind of care and attention which, though ancillary to the central business, will only be as brilliant as the people who attend to it.<br><br>Much as many people regard marketing and advertising as secondary elements, if you want 100&#8453; of your business to be world-class then you need 100% world-class people and practices.<br><br>Principal among those practices in the world of creating great advertising is an age&#45;old four-word phrase that applies to all greatness&#58;<br><br>No pain, no gain.<br><br>Wanna run a sub-four minute mile? Know it&#39;ll hurt.<br><br>Wanna look ripped&#63; Know there will be sacrifices.<br><br>Wanna write the great American novel&#63; Prepare to sit alone. A lot. For a long time.<br><br>Creatively-gifted and wanna be the best&#63; Prepare to outwork everyone else.<br><br>Wanna be the head of a world-changing social network&#63; Know that creative brilliance is but the fabled 1&#8453; &#45; inspiration. You still need the 99&#8453; perspiration.<br><br>Think of a moment that we&#39;ve all experienced:<br><br>It&#39;s taken you a long week of hard work but as 5pm Friday approaches, you crack it. You have something people are going to like.<br><br>Now everyone is off for Friday night fun. You like what you&#39;ve done and so in your mind there may not even be a choice to be made. You happily join them.<br><br>Next time this happens, try this simple exercise&#58;<br><br>Imagine 75&#45;year old you looking back on whatever life you&#39;ve had and ask if she or he is happy that you stopped working when you liked what you&#39;d done.<br><br>Me? I wouldn&#39;t have been able to budge from my work if I had something I liked.<br><br>Not until it was something I loved.<br><br>It hurt to work for that extra quality, it really did. I missed out on a bunch of stuff &#45; normal family life, wild and crazy partying, sleep, sanity, good health.<br><br>But for most of the late 1990s I was the highest earning copywriter in the UK, probably in the world.<br><br>I didn't notice at the time.<br><br>Guess I was too busy working.</p>
