		 <h1>Princess Cinderella von Chinchilla Bella Bambina</h1>
	     
	     <h3>The life and times of the world's most captivating little dog</h3>
		 
		 <p>Known to her subjects as 'Cindy', her royal highness was born in late 2015 in northern Connecticut, USA. Not that you can tell her age by looking at her. The Princess has always and will always look like a puppy. A puppy who rules her household with appropriately regal authority.
