         <p>Known to her subjects as 'Cindy' or 'Chinchi', her royal highness was born in late 2015 in northern Connecticut, USA. Not that you can tell her <br> age by looking at her. The Princess always has and always will look like a puppy - one who rules her household with unmistakably regal authority.</p>
