     <p>My 13 year-old turned to me the other day and asked me if I got paid a lot for doing advertising.<br><br>After a bit of back and forth he decided I did and that so did most people working in the business.<br><br>“So why is all advertising so abysmal?” came the eventual punch-line (yes, I know, cool vocab for 13.)<br><br>It’s a fascinating question when you ponder it. I for one know that nobody <em>sets out</em> to present little more than two wooden bozos mouthing marketing strategy at the world from whatever screen or a <em>yet another</em> car driving along a mountain/coastal road.<br><br>And yet, the above is basically the bread and butter of advertising.<br><br>Interestingly, when I tried to ‘fight back’ against my precocious lad by praising some of the more thoightful and witty-ish stuff like the <em>AT&T</em> girl and <em>Verizon</em>’s latest celebrity work it cut no ice whatsoever.<br><br>“Seriously, dad? Do you even watch <em>YouTube</em> and some of the brilliant characters on there? Milana Vayntrub sucks; and Ricky Gervais and Jamie Foxx being nothing but shills?! Gross!”<br><br>Whoa! Whooooooaaaaa! Vayn-what? Shills?<br><br>So he puts me straight, again shocking me by the stuff he knows - in this case the actual real name of the <em>AT&T</em> girl, not to mention the word ‘shill’ (we’re British and even I didn't know that word – though I will now use it like a <em>bawss</em>!)<br><br>I gather myself and tell my son the following:<br><br>People involved in making advertising are all super intelligent.<br><br>They don't set out to do bad advertising.<br><br>What happens is a company with a product to sell goes to an ad agency to come up with ideas to sell it.<br><br>Many of those ideas turn out to be advertising ideas because advertising is how you address a whole bunch of people – millions – all at the same time instead of visiting them one by one in person which would be time-consuming.<br><br>Let’s just say that the client (that’s what we call the company with the product) loves the advertising. Well, those people have bosses to answer to so they like to have the backing of actual evidence that their decision is right.<br><br>So what happens is that the agency does rough executions of the work and they test it in front of real people to get their response and see if there are any problems.<br><br>And that’s where the trouble starts.<br><br>Up until this point, every part of the process has been under the control of expert intelligence.<br><br>Now it also becomes a matter of courage.<br><br>Because when you show people something they will always comment. And what then becomes important is how you react to those comments.<br><br>It can take a certain courage when you believe one thing, but the people in the research – something that your bosses have access to – say something different.<br><br>Yes, you're the expert and the people being asked the questions aren’t. If they were, they’d be making their own products.<br><br>But what if the advertising fails and you've gone against what the people in the research group said?<br><br>Probably the most complex area in all of this research stuff is understanding and allowing for “the shock of the new”.<br><br>“The shock of the new” was a phrase created by an Australian art professor in 1980. He came up with it to describe the way that modern art impacted the world.<br><br>On one level it describes that feeling we all get when we see something we’ve never seen before and, in a way, it is shocking.<br><br>In fact, with no shock, what you’re looking at is something you feel comfortable with, something familiar.<br><br>Nearly all research done on advertising interprets “the shock of the new” as a bad thing – even though it’s the most important element you can have to move people, engage people.<br><br>In reality, the shock of the new is the Holy Grail of any art – commercial or otherwise – because it is the very epitome of grabbing people’s attention in an elevating way; as opposed to talking down to them in their over-crowded comfort zone.<br><br>That ‘talking down’ is what makes up 90% of advertising and it’s a waste of money, huge.<br><br>All you’re doing is dumping your message into that huge bucket of everyday things that people have to wade through, thereby tarnishing your message with the denigrating stench of the ordinary.<br><br>(“Denigrating stench of the ordinary” was the second thing my 13-year old made a note of – oh, yes, he takes notes! – after “shock of the new” in readiness to pole-axe a teacher in a future essay or impress a crush.)<br><br>I didn't want to get too technical with my boy, but, in conclusion, I pointed out that most marketing clients didn't stay in their jobs that long – 18 months at most, if that – which made them perhaps more anxious not to fail than to make a mark.<br><br>So it was kind of easier to make sure what you signed fitted in, rather than stood out.<br><br>“But that defeats the whole object of the whole idea of advertising, dad.”<br><br>At which point I did what I always did with my boys, which is to muddy the waters with a bunch of “you’ll understand when you get older” and “It’s not as easy as you think” malarkey and moved on, that look of skepticism tinged with – was it… disappointment? - in my son’s eyes pursuing me as I left the room.</p>
