    <p>One of the funniest things I've witnessed over the past couple years in and around the ad agency business is the constant <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> that&#39;s been going on around the actual word &#39;advertising&#39; itself.<br><br>It reminds me of this diet I once got into based around the theory that drinks were less fattening than solids.<br><br>I was at a groovy party regaling a rather charming model with the joys of drinking myself fit. She quickly put me in my place.<br><br>&#147;Listen dummy,&#148; she said, &#147;if it isn't water it&#39;s food.&#148;<br><br>It reminded me of something Fairfax Cone, founder of the original Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB), said. I&#39;m presuming it was in answer to some asinine nonsense in a similarly delusional vein to mine above. It blows away every bit as instantly all the current self&#45;serving, tortuous, cod&#45;revolutionary faddism in marketing services that has come in on the digital tide&#58;<br><br>&#147;Advertising is what you do when you can't go see someone. That's all it is.&#148;</p>
