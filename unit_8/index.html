     <p>Alternative Brand Perspectives is a service for marketing custodians whose brands have communications issues. We call ourselves invisible menders, i.e. the closest thing there is to discovering a problem, clicking your fingers and having the problem disappear. Whatever the creative or strategic issue we take care of it - usually within 48 hours. </p>

     <p>We are equally happy casting a peerless eye over existing work or creating from scratch; working for marketers or for their agencies. Either way, every engagement begins with a non-disclosure agreement, ensuring that our services are subject to inviolable secrecy in perpetuity. This way our services can be surgically-focused and painstakingly designed never to embarrass existing partners. You will certainly never find us peeking back at you from trade media. Menders are selected via the most rigorous measures possible. Measures designed to ensure we offer unimpeachably world-class expertise only, be it in strategy, ideation, design, writing in any medium or platform.</p>
