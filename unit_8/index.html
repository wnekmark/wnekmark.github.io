     <p>One of the funniest things I&#39ve witnessed over the past couple years in and around the ad agency business is the hilarious <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> that&#39s been going on around the actual word &#39advertising&#39 itself.<br><br>
     It reminds me of something a supermodel friend of mine once said as she witheringly laid waste the would-be dietary &#39miracle&#39 of fruit and veggie smoothies .<br><br>&#34Trust me, poppet&#34 she said, &#34if it isn&#39t water it&#39s food.&#34<br><br>Fairfax Cone, founder of the original Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB), said something that, once heard, blows away all the current self-serving, tortuous, cod-revolutionary, faddism in marketing and marketing services every bit as effectively:<br><br><strong>&#34Advertising is what you do when you can't go see someone. That&#39s all it is.&#34</strong></p>
