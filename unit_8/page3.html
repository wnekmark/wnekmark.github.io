  <p>"Focus on what never changes" - a phrase you'll hear over and over on this site.

Having to work hard and dig deep to be the best never changes.

At your company, good or even ok creativity may be preferable to all that goes with shooting for greatness: the time, the trouble, the exhaustion, the anger, the alcohol/drug intake, the lack of socializing, the mood swings, the divorces.

Yes the digital age is a wondrous leveler, making available what Marx called the means of production to a bigger portion of humanity than ever before.

Which makes me so disappointed when I hear this beautiful idea - 'digital' - used as a byword for fast as in slapdash and mediocre.

Yes businesses get built fast these digitally-powered days and in completely different ways, often with no need of capital expenditure other than the cost of a laptop.

But when a business has been built, its façade still needs maintenance. Not least that part of its façade that exists in the minds of customers: the marketing and the advertising.

Marketing and advertising take a different kind of care and attention which, though ancillary to the central business, will only be as brilliant as the people who attend to it.

Much as many people regard these marketing and advertising as secondary elements, if you want 100% of your business to be world-class then you need 100% world-class people and practices.

Principal among those practices in the world of creating great advertising is an age-old four-word phrase that applies to all greatness:

No pain, no gain.

Wanna run a sub-four minute mile? Know it’ll hurt.

Wanna look ripped? Know there will be sacrifices.

Wanna write the great American novel? Prepare to sit alone. A lot. For a long time.

Creatively-gifted and wanna be the best? Prepare to outwork everyone else.

Wanna be the head of a world-changing social network? Know that creative brilliance is but the fabled 1% - inspiration - you still need the 99% perspiration.

Think of a moment that we've all experienced: 

It’s taken you a long week of hard work but as 5pm Friday approaches, you crack it. You have something people are going to like.

Now everyone’s off for Friday night fun. You like what you've done and so in your mind there may not even be a choice to be made. You happily join them.

Next time this happens, try this simple exercise:

Imagine 75-year old you looking back on whatever life you've had and ask if she or he is happy that you stopped working when you liked what you'd done.

Me? I wouldn’t have been able to budge from my work if I had something I liked. 

Not until it was something I loved.

It hurt to work for that extra quality, it really did. I missed out on a bunch of stuff - partying mainly.

But for most of the late 1990s I was the highest earning copywriter in the UK - probably in the world. 

I didn't notice at the time.

I was too busy working.
