     <p>When I was a younger creative at Ogilvy in London my boss was a thickset Yorkshireman who favored heavy brogue shoes. If he was particularly displeased with my work he would kick me sharply in the shins. It really hurt.<br><br>Just thinking about such a thing from the vantage point of 2016 makes me criiinge!<br><br>In today’s ad agency industry we all live in Niceville, capital city of ‘Everybody Gets A Trophy!’ (EGAT) world.<br><br>In the ad agency business, EGAT world gives us many ‘joys’ such as:<br><br>She: Did you remember to lock the doors of the Buick? …Oh, and did you shut the apartment windows?<br><br>The object of this endlessly run tv spot seems to be to demonstrate a Buick app that lets you shut your car doors remotely.<br><br>So ardent were the creators of the spot not only to lionize the app, but also bang home its Buick-ness, that minor issues like normal speech and human behavior paled into insignificance.<br><br>In my many years of being alive I have never once heard a human refer to their car by its brand name.<br><br>But then, ‘Did you remember to lock the car doors?’ is just so hopelessly unbranded!<br><br>Buick’s solution: transgress normal human behavior and speech.<br><br>Proper solution: find a cleverer, more elegant way of create desire for your car that doesn't involve making yourself look and sound ridiculous.<br><br>Ensuring the above is what a creative director is for.<br><br>Oh, and while the creative director’s there, she/he may also want to take a look at ‘Oh, and did you close the apartment windows?’<br><br>Leaving aside what is clearly a complex HBO-type couple where, either the husband has some awfully sad and exotic affliction that makes him forget to lock and close things, or the wife is some misogynist’s nightmare who can’t help but torment her husband over the most trivial domestic minutiae even while sunbathing on vacation, the normal language is, ‘Did you close the windows at home?’<br><br>Just like no human declares the brand of their car in the real world, neither do they identify dwelling type.<br><br>‘Did you close the windows to our converted lighthouse?’ or ‘Did you close the windows to our suburban Colonial?’ are over-specific to the point of weirdness.<br><br>My guess? The shot in the above car spot where they do the joke of the clever husband with the app who is – haha – actually not so clever because he didn’t close the windows, shows pigeons invading through an open window.<br><br>Yes, pigeons are urban birds and urban dwellers tend to live in apartments.<br><br>But why this requires butchering the language to specify can only be down to three possible reasons: i) the client has over-thought things to the point of meltdown, ii) the ‘creative director’ has done that, or iii) the creative director was hired for reasons other than world-class creative judgment - reasons such as being a really nice person who really hates to demotivate his staff by being mean and saying things like, "NO - please go away and bring me back something that wasn't lifted straight from the part of the brief where it identified the target as affluent urban professionals."<br><br>The law of averages and current ad agency culture suggests that it’s probably a combination of all three with emphasis on the third.<br><br>Like many a son or daughter or employee in denial, while I disliked my Ogilvy creative director I have to admit that he taught me a thing or two.<br><br>Above all he stopped me developing any idea of selling my clients short and taking their money under false pretenses by being lazy or intellectually dishonest (or just plain old not good enough).<br><br>While some of his behavior was reprehensible, when I think about it he was only really mean with the people he rated.<br><br>I had already gone through Cambridge as a student, a place where your study director would debate you so fiercely at the merest suspicion of laziness or intellectual wrongheadedness, disingenuous or dishonesty that some students were reduced to wrecks.<br><br>(It’s because at places like Cambridge and Oxford and Harvard and Yale professors are not teachers per se, they are at those institutions to pursue their own work. Students are there to pick up as much as a professor believes any student shows the aptitude to absorb.)<br><br>As a creative director myself I guess I was a combination of all my teachers and bosses combined (though I would never and have never considered any kind of physical response).<br><br>Eventually, like too many high-fliers in ad agencies, I got promoted beyond my capabilities into not just creative but overall agency management. The pressure of the bad fit rendered me increasingly overwhelmed and defensive and abrasive and defensive. One day I looked into the mirror and disliked the person I saw staring back at me and decided to quit.<br><br>Three years of life-coaching later I am back to being more like the person I always wanted to be, at the very least at peace with myself.<br><br>And yet.<br><br>Even me 2.0 is gobsmacked at what I see emanating from a world I was once a proud part of.<br><br>I use the Buick campaign as an example because I want to annoy as few people as possible (I told you, I’ve changed) and the amount of media money behind the work clearly shows the client is delighted to have it out there representing Buick’s products, culture and values.<br><br>The problem is, you can't expect your would-be, well-to-do, above-averagely intelligent target to revisit your irrelevant car brand by using deeply flawed and problematic language.<br><br>If your tagline was, ‘These Buicks goes real good!’ you should probably expect your customers to seriously doubt the authority of the message and thus on some level – subconscious or otherwise - the quality of the car.<br><br>Depicting a young couple at night with a screaming baby and having the husband say, ‘I’ll take him to the store in the Buick’ as opposed to the normal human, ‘Let me drive him around a bit and he’ll go to sleep’ is a failure of quality control that must surely reflect badly on the product.<br><br>No such language would ever have got past me or any creative director I would consider a peer.<br><br>(I shudder to think of the injury I would have suffered at the hands of my former Ogilvy boss had I presented work like that!)<br><br>How does such less-than-optimal work form such a big part of ad agencies' output these days? I got a strong clue from a former colleague over a coffee the other day. She was a board level account director who is now a major CMO.<br><br>We were catching up after 18 months or so and had a good old gossip. Then I noticed her staring at me in an odd way.<br><br>‘You’re… different,’ she said.<br><br>‘What? Not going crazy from being a chairman, boss, new business director and creative director?’<br><br>‘Yes,’ she said, ‘this consultancy business really suits you. You used to be so…’<br><br>'Don't tell me – difficult?’<br><br>‘Yes! People used to tell me just that. That you were difficult to work with.’<br><br>We continued talking. And at some point I asked her if she felt the work her ad agency was giving her was brilliant. She admitted that she didn’t think it was but that she was really rooting for them because the client-agency relationship was brilliant.<br><br>I was confused.<br><br>How could a relationship be brilliant if the work was less than optimal? I asked her. She wriggled a bit and we sparred a bit as adfolk from different disciplines do. My passionate belief as a thrusting adman was - and still is, I discovered, as an older, wiser practitioner - that the pursuit of greatness often requires the suspension of niceties.<br><br>Most lethal and counter-productive nicety? The word YES.<br><br>No. Not good enough. Close but no cigar. Try again. No. Nope. Not quite. Keep going. This is your fifth go at this and you get paid $350,000! You get one more go or you lose the brief!<br><br>These words and their ilk are the stock in trade of the top creative director in every single profession where quality is paramount, I told my friend.<br><br>I told her of a lunch I’d had recently with a CEO of one of those huge dull agencies that turn out huge dull work and how she’d praised her chief creative officer partner for being SUCH a nice person.<br><br>Sure, I thought to myself, judging by the work he’s clearly never said NO in his life.<br><br>In the creative director profession, I told my friend, you have to be have the capacity to be difficult, you have to say NO. Every day. Many times. Yes it sucks to be you, but NO is your most important tool. Seems some people who worked for her and on the agency side had forgotten that. Yes, there’s always a balance: how much difficulty/delay-via-NO are you prepared to accept in the service of excellence? At least enough to ensure that your output doesn't murder common-sense and normal human interaction in pursuit of at best naïve and mechanistic ideas of branding.<br><br>‘Wow!’ my friend said, ‘who’s your life coach?’<br><br>‘Why?’<br><br>'I want to send them a bottle of champagne! 18 months ago you would have said everything you’ve just said with a snarl not a smile. I would have been too scared by the snarl to pay attention to what you were saying.’<br><br>‘Touché,’ I said. ‘So when you say NO to the next round of work, smile.’</p>
