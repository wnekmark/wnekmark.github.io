     <p>As a human ‘afflicted’ with the creativity gene, my mind wanders freely and makes all manner of odd connections.<br><br>Recently, at a big American ad agency in NYC, as I looked across the entirety of a huge open-plan floor, l found myself thinking about the climax of James Bond movies where, in the villain’s extravagant lair, all the bad guys sport identical matching outfits.<br><br>In this agency’s case the matching outfit was jeans, sneakers, pale-colored shirt (daringly – lol) unbuttoned at the top covering white (almost entirely male) skin in its thirties.<br><br>When I later considered it, I realized what had piqued my consciousness was the ambience, Dictionary.com definition:<br><br>1. the mood, character, quality, tone, atmosphere, etc., particularly of the environment or milieu.<br><br>The agency ambience was vanilla, Google definition: <em><b>adjective</b>b></em> <em>informal</em><br><br>1. having no special or extra features; ordinary or standard.<br><br><em>“choosing plain vanilla technology wherever you can will save you money.”</em><br><br>Vanilla is a mindset focused on the middle of the road.<br><br>It’s a legitimate means of getting through life unscathed, sure.<br><br>But maybe not to so much if you want to do stuff like stand out.<br><br>Increasingly, America’s brands are deciding they need to do just that.<br><br>This realization is causing American brands to zag, catching the mainstream American ad agency industry on the hop.<br><br>Which is odd, because isn't creating ways for brands to zag, i.e. stand out in the marketplace, the very raison d’être of all ad agencies?<br><br>You’d think so.<br><br>It certainly started out that way, in the days when vanilla was just an ice cream flavor.<br><br>The creatively brilliant icons of American advertising were all arch zaggers - the Bernbachs, Chiats, Fallons, Gossages, Clows – even David Ogilvy himself.<br><br>But you know what?<br><br><em>Being creatively remarkable isn’t easy.<br><br>Not least because remarkable creative people are far and few between.</em><br><br>How had an industry literally invented to perform at the creative, differentiating edge of marketing communications become “ordinary or standard”?<br><br>Answer:<br><br><em>Being remarkable isn't easy.<br><br>Not least because remarkable creative people are far and few between.</em><br><br>It’s a universal talent issue, the way of the world rather than something confined to the US ad agency business:<br><br><br><br>I’m literally turning on the tv screen in front of me. Whatever the field in question, I’ll consider its ‘top-talent’ issue.<br><br>And it’s… the NFL.<br><br>Phew. Lucky. An easy one.<br><br>In what is understood to be a quarterback-driven sport, how many top-level QBs are there in the entire sport?<br><br>Let’s take the (tough) survey from the beginning of August by tv sports network ESPN.<br><br>ESPN’s survey was draconian, admitting only Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger in the top tier. If we allow in NFL MVP Cam Newton, Drew Brees, Russell Wilson and Andrew Luck too, that makes seven people.<br><br>Just seven top-tier performers in an entire industry – and that’s being kind, according to the experts.<br><br>In fact, the numbers are similar in all industries and pursuits.<br><br>What’s up with that?<br><br>Well, it seems top-tier creative talent is not what the vast majority of these agencies care about.<br><br>Clearly, somewhere sometime some entrepreneurial US ad agency type decided to start an ad agency based on something other than creative brilliance – be it executional, strategic, whatever - and found a huge success on his (it will inevitably have been a man I’m afraid) hands.<br><br>
     This individual not only knew he didn't have top-tier creativity, he turned that seeming disadvantage into a virtue.<br><br>While top-tier creative talent may be in short supply, there’s never a shortage of smart movers and shakers.<br><br>Such folk, invariably from the account handling side of the ad agency, have a strong handle on stuff like politics and human psychology and don’t actually make advertising. They make the relationships, the glue that binds clients to the ad agency.<br><br>Having got where they are by virtue of great insight and intelligence wrapped in an attractive and convincing package, all adding up to an expertise at making business relationships, these people proceeded to base and build their new agencies on the same principles.<br><br>No top-tier creativity, no awards? No problem for these folks:<br><br><em>“We have a fresh new take on creativity. Much creativity only distracts an agency from thinking deeply about a client’s business. Clients are the ones who bring the real value. We believe our job is not to make extravagant leaps but to mine, understand and project the value that our brilliant clients have created and let that truth do the talking instead of distracting from it with pretty words and pictures.”</em><br><br>Some version of the above ‘pioneering’ philosophy created a whole new lease of life for US ad agencies, a whole new ballgame where the objective was not being different from your clients, for how did that help you understand their issues?<br><br>The objective was to be as much like your clients as possible.<br><br>Creativity came to mean how tightly and faithfully you could deliver your client’s marketing strategy to tv screen, radio waves, page or billboard.<br><br>To this day, entire multi-national ad agency brand groups proceed along these very lines.<br><br>Of course, these companies are ad agencies in name only; in reality they offer something closer to ‘marketing strategy dissemination services’.<br><br>Without the combustible and potentially disruptive energy of real creativity in the mix, the above agencies embarked upon cosy, lengthy and profitable arrangements with largely agreeable clients.<br><br>So effective and robust were these arrangements that it took the advent of a whole new industrial age to shake everything up.<br><br>On the face of it, the digital age played right into the hands of the dissemination service-type US ad agencies (which had by then in many cases ballooned into large networks) because it offered yet more distraction from the disruption of creativity.<br><br>Digital offered such ‘closeness’ to consumers, that many happily saw it as the end of the ‘guessing game’ where expensive work resulting from a ‘creative moment’ went out and stayed out for several months irrespective of its actual effectiveness or impact.<br><br>At first, digital seemed to offer a release from that scenario because its interactive nature allowed for continuous improvement rather than reliance on anything as expensive, unquantifiable and high-maintenance as what became known as a ‘traditional creative people’.<br><br>Very quickly, of course, it became clear that digital was far too all-embracing for any particular interest to manipulate or control.<br><br>It offered access for all to a new way of human being, a way that allowed people to get from A to Z at the speed of thought (or at the very least the speed of their wireless service provider).<br><br>Whether your ‘from A to Z’ was from seeing something to owning it or from not knowing something about something (a brand, a product, a person, a penguin) to knowing everything about it - and all points in between and beyond; or whether it was from seeing a thinly-veiled marketing strategy posing as ‘entertainment’ or impartial information, to hating the brand that regarded you as someone of such meager intelligence that you could ever be taken in by it.<br><br>Digital empowerment has of course transformed the American marketplace, exploding marketers’ access to consumer mindspace (my 9, 11 and 13 year olds are shopping the second they open their eyes at 5.30 am EST, darn ‘em).<br><br>It’s the most exciting time imaginable… for all but those wishing to maintain the status quo.<br><br>The digital age has forced even the most conservative, blindly-loyal US ad agency clients to take note of the disparity between the sheer diversity, energy and resonance in the endless images emanating from their increasingly powerful and ever-present mobile screen - and the plain, ordinary, standard, in short vanilla ideas presented by their lumbering, expensive ad agency of record.<br><br>Leading client, Brad Jakeman of Pepsico, is in the vanguard of those disappointed in what he regards as the ad agency industry’s lack of diversity.<br><br>In a famous speech last October to the American Association of National Advertisers, Jakeman spoke of his disappointment at walking into meetings with ad agencies only to see people on the ad agency side identical to the people on his (client) side. (What’s the famous phrase? When two people in business invariably agree, one of them is unnecessary.)<br><br>Putting aside for now the inconvenient fact that diversity of personnel by no means guarantees diversity or quality of ideas, Jakeman then put his money where his mouth is by opening a Pepsico production company in Manhattan’s, Soho.<br><br>Not only Jakeman, but even the most conservative, loyal clients understand the need to at least experiment with some diverse sparkle in their marketing.<br><br>Increasingly, even those clients unwilling to upset the cosy applecart of long-time AOR arrangements, are injecting at least some non-vanilla creativity into their lives via side-projects to smaller sexier shops.<br><br>Some brands now have a dozen or more (sometimes many many more) agencies.<br><br>Marketing budgets are finite. So the big marketing strategy dissemination service agencies, which still commonly occupy AOR status and receive the lion’s share of those budgets, are now suffering the most ferocious budget cuts as, among other things, money is funneled off into the aforementioned side projects.<br><br>Among those “other things” above is a growing realization in client ranks that any creative hegemony traditional agencies may once have enjoyed is over.<br><br>The US ad agency industry’s main reaction to this threat?<br><br>The Great Diversity Debate.<br><br>Yes, it may well be rich considering the amount of effort and expense expended by the ad agency business on its own remorseless vanillazation, but, having failed to pick up on the changing requirements of its clients, even something as arrogant and dyed-in-the-wool as the American ad agency business doesn't need telling twice.<br><br>Suddenly its all “diversity this” and “diversity that”, with the genuine understanding that the increase in sexual, racial and all manner of diversity in the ad agency business is long overdue, running neck and neck with sheer unadulterated hypocrisy.<br><br>That hypocrisy is not only to be found in those male white middle-aged ad agency leaders who seem to have become lifelong pro-diversity campaigners overnight.<br><br>It isn’t even confined to men. One leading self-elected spokeswoman makes a habit of getting on the anti-boys club bandwagon every time she is about to lose a job – despite that fact that in those jobs she is invariably as much of an enemy to rival women as any man could ever be.<br><br>And then there’s Cindy Gallop.<br><br>Cindy is a fierce pro-diversity campaigner whose profile seems to rise daily as all those she doubtless terrifies hilariously bend over backwards to embrace her.<br><br>People like Kevin Roberts, who criticize Cindy on the grounds of being self-serving/publicizing, are like those who criticize people who give huge sums to charity for doing it for the publicity: the recipients of the charity couldn't give a hoot - they're just glad for the money.<br><br>But in terms of the ad agency industry, what does Cindy Gallop’s crusade actually mean?<br><br>A clue is in the fact that CEOs of US ad agencies are so eager to give a thumbs up to Gallop’s ideas to change an imbalance entirely their own making!  Needless to say, supporting any such crusade automatically suggests you’re on the right side of it…<br><br>More importantly, those CEOs can see ‘the finish line’ of their own careers. Right now, they are delighted to support anything that gives the impression to their clients that they are in any way modernizing and meeting the new world head-on, because it buys them time to get to their finish lines.<br><br>Yes, I look forward to (potentially dramatically) improved diversity numbers in all major US ad agencies.<br><br>But I also predict that the vast majority of those ‘diversity’ additions will be in roles that are as far away as it is possible to be from any executive power.<br><br>Cindy Gallop and others are already ahead of that to a certain extent – in her case demanding an increase in the amount of women in the C-suite, something with which even Sir Martin Sorrell agrees. At least publicly.<br><br>Most CEOs, however, are just buying time by shifting to ‘Plan B’.<br><br>Plan B is where we get to the flaws of most pro-diversity campaigns.<br><br>While I predict too a marked increase in numbers of women finally smashing the glass ceiling and entering the C-suite, the question is: what kind of women will they be?<br><br>Or women carefully nurtured and vetted to be as close to clones of The Big Vanilla - the existing middle-aged conservative conformist white male club members - as it is possible to be?<br><br>Because, if so, what actually changes?<br><br>My passionate contention is that the latter merely empowers The Big Vanilla.<br><br>It might change the icing in terms of numbers. Some women who actually want to change things may also sneak through. You can even say that it’s a start and that something is better than nothing.<br><br>But let’s not kid ourselves that clients, increasingly perspicacious in ad agency mores, will find any timely or substantive change to the creative offer of their agencies and thus no resonant reason to re-appraise the US ad agency model.<br><br>Unless they go to smaller, nimbler agencies they’ll still be getting vanilla for the foreseeable future.<br><br>At the risk of wading further out of my depth and putting more words out of place to spark the knee-jerk brigade, the above is not just a woman issue, it applies to all diversities.<br><br>In the case of an African-American C-suite candidate, what real difference is achieved if, again, that candidate is carefully vetted to ensure she or he is vanilla in all but skin color?<br><br>I’m a middle-aged white male – though as one born in England and brought up exclusively by women - a barely-English-speaking French mother and Russian grandmother (both immigrants) and two years older big sister (I never knew my Polish father) I’m not your average American middle-aged white male.<br><br>Although not Asian or Latino or Afro-Caribbean my blood is pure mongrel.<br><br>Did this make me any more conscious of the problems and obstacles of being different? Not one bit. We, along with my younger brother, lived in two little rooms above my mom’s sewing shop in one of the poorest parts of London. Most of the time we were fully occupied getting from one day to the next.<br><br>As I somehow became lucky enough to emerge from my childhood relatively successfully on some levels, did I do so gaining greater insight into the realities of being an immigrant and cultural outsider? Nope. I was too busy trying to fit in – something I was brought up to do on pain of beating.<br><br>Did the fact that I happened to be white instead of brown or black or yellow have an impact on the above? Impossible to say: racism in England has a history less immediately charged with the profound turbulence and horror of the American experience and so the divides have never been so sharply drawn.<br><br>The part of London where I was raised was predominantly Afro-Caribbean, Polish and Irish (West Indians or Africans, Polacks and Paddies were the titles for each, the word ‘colored’ more common than ‘black’); if a white lad called a black lad the n-word, that lad would invariably fire straight back with “Milky Bar Kid!”, the blond white seven-year old pretend cowboy who shilled for the popular white chocolate brand in tv spots. (Though I do remember a boyfriend of my sister’s using the n-word once and being thrown out of the house by my mother. But then it was a tight-knit neighborhood and everyone looked out for one another.)<br><br>Did the fact that my entire being was formed by the three women who raised me in turn raise my understanding of the obstacles women face in the world? Sadly not one bit. The women who raised me were indomitable symbols of strength, rulers of the household and beyond. Women’s travails are not part of the fabric of my upbringing, on the contrary.<br><br>As an ad agency leader, was I nice/mean to men/women/ethnic diversities/gays? I think it’s fair to say that I by that time my typical creative person’s lack of bandwidth had exhausted me I was equally mean to all-comers with no hint of favoritism one way or the other.<br><br>But through it all, nary a friend nor enemy would bestow upon me the quality of ‘vanilla’, and whatever any client thought they might get out of me, they invariably harbored at least the suspicion that it would be something different.<br><br>Hundreds of millions of sales, Cannes Grand Prixs and hundreds of millions of YouTube views later it could be argued that they were right.<br><br>Does this damn me to nothing other than membership in the male white middle-aged cartel that Cindy Gallop so loathes?<br><br>On the face of it yes, but in fact entirely wrongly and unjustly.<br><br>Are there others like me? Of course.<br><br>Highly creative, experienced, uncompromising, digitally savvy top-tier folks probably earning more now independently than when they fled/were spat out by the Big Vanilla.<br><br>Hilariously, our number – call us ‘the original bohemians’ - those whose non-conformism actually built the modern advertising business in the days before the move to vanilla, reflect all the precise qualities that modern clients are seeking plus the experience.<br><br>Sure, some clients fall for the thinly-veiled money-saving trick of what I call ‘the youth untruth’, but decreasingly so.<br><br>On the grounds of youth alone, a young person is as useful as a young penguin.<br><br>In order to get inside the minds of millennials, a client no more needs millennials in her or his ad agency than Thomas Harris needed to be a serial killer to get inside the mind of Hannibal Lecter.<br><br>In order to get inside the minds of women, a client no more needs women in his or her ad agency than Thomas Harris needed to be a woman to get inside the mind of FBI agent Clarice Starling.<br><br>What a client needs is a brilliant creator of ideas – be they white, black, brown, green, male, female, transsexual, young, middle-aged, elderly or other.<br><br>If, as an ad agency, you merely employ the same old headhunters who recirculate the same old mainly male white vanilla talent to comply with the prevailing Big Vanilla US ad agency requirements, then you not only demean yourself and harm the right to work of an entire generation, you also diminish your talent pool and narrow your chances to find the only thing that both you and your clients desperately need: world-class talent.<br><br>Full diversity both broadens and deepens the potential talent pool and  gives everyone equal opportunity.<br><br>For clients seeking brilliance beyond vanilla, the chances of finding it immeasurably increase.<br><br>Any kind of would-be corrective witch-hunt regarding any section of society – including middle-aged white males – has the opposite effect.<br><br>In terms of the ‘original bohemians’, still the biggest available top talent pool, we were the Big Vanilla’s original enemy and it has been culling them for decades already.<br><br>It remains a massive pool of talent, one that Cindy Gallop and even Brad Jakeman should recognize as a powerful source of allies not enemies.</p>
